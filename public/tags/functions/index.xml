      <description>R SeriesThese posts will follow everything I have learned or stumbled upon during my time in Mercyhurst’s Data Science program. This first function is called combine and it is launched by using this line of code c(). As demonstrated below the combine function combines all the data within the parenthesis into a list and that list is stored within the designated variable.

      <description>R Series 2Functions length(), diff(), and mean()Last post we examined the use of the combine funtion to throw an array of numbers into a variable. Now we will examine some functions that actually affect the array. First we will look at the function length(). To do so we will need a list of numbers. Since I am a big baseball guy, I used Chicago Cub’s first basemen, Anthony Rizzo’s, home runs over his last five seasons.</description>
