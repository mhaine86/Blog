      <description>Let’s talk about normally distributed data. Normally distributed data is the unachievable unicorn, it’s like Kristaps Porzingas, you do everything that you can to get it, but it rarely ever occurs in nature. Normally distributed data is a perfect bell curve and is statistically predictable.Its probability is predictable through a function in R called pnorm. Let’s supposed that a study found that foot lengths for Japanese women are normally distributed with a mean of 24.</description>

      <description>R Series 3Functions seq(),rep(), and standard deviationIn the last post we went over significant functions like mean() and diff() this post will examine the seq() or sequence function, the rep() or repeat function, and a way to calculate standard deviation with basic functions.
First, we will examine the sequence function. The sequence function runs by inputing two numbers seperated by a comma in the parenthesis. You then have the option of inputing parameters.</description>
